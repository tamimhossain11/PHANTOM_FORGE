        "That's how our very first advanced flood surveillance drone met the ground hard. After months of sleepless nights, trial runs, and endless tweaking, we finally saw it take off… only to watch it crash within moments. Our hearts sank. With the National Round of the World Invention Competition and Exhibition just two weeks away, it felt like the world had stopped.",
        "But here's the thing: failure wasn't the end of our story.",
        "We went back to our little lab, still crushed but not broken. Piece by piece, idea by idea, we rebuilt. This time, we went lighter and stronger. Carbon-fiber body with a hexagonal frame. It wasn't just about fixing a drone. It was about proving to ourselves that we could rise after falling.",
        "Fast forward to 27 May 2025, Mohammadpur open playground. We held our breath as the drone lifted again. And this time… it soared. It mapped routes with GPS, reported damage, even carried emergency supplies. Every mission we dreamed of. It completed. Perfectly.",
        "We didn't cheer right away. We just stood there, frozen, as tears welled up. Then the joy hit us all at once. Laughing, crying, hugging.",
        "Because this wasn't just a successful test. It was proof that we could crash, rebuild, and still fly higher than before."

        "At Team Phantom Forge, every prototype is a leap toward the future of underwater robotics. HydroJan 0.4 marked our biggest leap yet, a fully functioning Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) designed and built to meet the demanding standards of international competitions like 7th World Invention Competition and Exhibition.",
        "This version was not just a test platform. It was the result of months of planning, design, and late-night problem solving. From hardware and control systems to software integration and documentation, we built a clear roadmap where every subsystem had a goal and every team member had a mission. Our aim was simple: create an AUV that could navigate complex underwater tasks while promoting innovation with a purpose.",
        "**Design Breakthroughs**",
        "Previous builds taught us valuable lessons. The previous prototypes showed us what worked and what didn't. For HydroJan 0.4, we introduced a capsule-shaped hull that balances internal space with smooth hydrodynamics, giving the vehicle greater stability during deep-water navigation.",
        "We paired this new design with high-performance thrusters sourced from Rovmaker, known for precision and reliability. This upgrade delivered sharper turns, stronger propulsion, and exceptional depth control, critical for competitive tasks. Inside, a mild steel frame provides strength under pressure, while a lightweight aluminum shell offers corrosion resistance without adding unnecessary weight.",
        "**Next Steps**",
        "With the body, movement, and endurance now proven, our next focus is integrating a torpedo system to expand mission capabilities, pushing HydroJan closer to a fully competition-ready platform for World Invention Competition and Exhibition and beyond.",
        "**Powered by Teamwork**",
        "Behind HydroJan 0.4 is a diverse team of engineers, programmers, and designers working side by side. Every improvement reflects not just technical skill but a shared commitment to innovation and real-world impact.",
        "HydroJan 0.4 is more than a machine; it's a milestone. Each version brings us closer to mastering underwater robotics and to inspiring solutions that serve humanity.",
        "To explore the depths of possibility—one breakthrough at a time."
